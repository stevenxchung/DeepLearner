## 🧱 Requirements

The following software needs to be installed on your local machine before running.

### 📦 Package Managers

For speed and efficiency we highly recommend the following:

- [**Bun**](https://bun.sh) – Fast JavaScript runtime & package manager
- [**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) – Blazing fast Python environment manager (written in Rust)

### 🤖 Local LLMs

- [**Ollama**](https://ollama.com/download) – A streamlined, open-source platform for running and managing LLMs on your local machine. It simplifies downloading, setting up, and interacting with open-source models

> ℹ️ Make sure Ollama is running in the background for LLM-based workflows.

### 🎞️ Video to Audio Tools

- [**FFmpeg**](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) – A powerful multimedia toolkit for handling audio, video, subtitles, and metadata
- [**yt-dlp**](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) – A feature-rich CLI tool for downloading videos and audio from thousands of websites (a modern fork of youtube-dl)

### 🎙️ Audio to Text (Transcription)

To enable GPU-accelerated transcription with [`faster-whisper`](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper):

- NVIDIA GPU with sufficient VRAM for your chosen model
- NVIDIA GPU driver (version depends on your CUDA setup)
- [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) (typically version 11+)
- [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn-downloads) (sometimes bundled with CUDA)

To ensure PyTorch is installed with CUDA support:

```bash
# ./transcription-api
uv pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128 && uv sync
```
